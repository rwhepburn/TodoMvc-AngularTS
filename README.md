TodoMvc-AngularTS
=================

TodoMvc with AngularJS and TypeScript, following up @markrendle talk on NDC 2014

At the end of his talk, Mark sais that he is going to put the complete code on GitHub and also 
send it to the maintainers of the TodoMvc repository to replace their not-so-good TypeScript AngularJS sample.
However, this has not happened so far, so I typed in the code manually following the talk and posted it here.
